3) Getting Started with Github
Here is a link that is good intro to Github: 
http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

To get started with our github, open the github deskstop on your computer and type
git clone https://github.com/dataViz-UCSDGuardian/Training.git

This will clone the training session to your Github. 
To add to the github training repo, create a new branch with your name by typing
git checkout -b myBranchName

When you name your files, include your name in each title so as to avoid merge conflicts. 
Even better, create a folder with your name and put all your files in there. 

When pushing, type
git add . 
git commit -m "Commiting my name's files"
git push origin myBranchName
